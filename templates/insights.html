  <!-- Diabetes Insights -->
  <h2>Diabetes Insights</h2>

  <h3>Age Distribution (Diabetes)</h3>
  <p>This chart shows the distribution of people with diabetes across different age groups. It helps us understand if
    diabetes is more common at certain ages. Typically, diabetes is more common in older populations, particularly
    after the age of 45. However, with the rise of lifestyle-related factors, type 2 diabetes is increasingly being
    diagnosed in younger individuals as well.</p>
  <div>{{ graph_age | safe }}</div>

  <h3>BMI vs Glucose Levels (Diabetes)</h3>
  <p>This graph shows the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and glucose levels in people with diabetes. It
    helps us see if higher BMI is linked to higher glucose levels.
    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> A BMI above 30 is considered obese, and people in this category are more likely to
    have elevated glucose levels or even develop type 2 diabetes. An average BMI range falls between 18.5 to 24.9,
    which is considered healthy. Levels above this range indicate increasing risks for health issues, including
    diabetes.
  </p>
  <div>{{ graph_bmi_glucose | safe }}</div>

  <h3>Blood Pressure by Diabetes Outcome</h3>
  <p>This chart shows how blood pressure varies between people with different diabetes outcomes, such as controlled or
    uncontrolled diabetes. It helps us understand the connection between blood pressure and diabetes management.
    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Elevated blood pressure (above 130/80 mmHg) is common among people with poorly
    controlled diabetes and can lead to further complications like heart disease and kidney problems.
  </p>
  <div>{{ graph_bp_outcome | safe }}</div>

  <h3>Correlation Heatmap (Diabetes)</h3>
  <p>This heatmap shows how different factors, like age, BMI, and glucose levels, are related to each other. Darker
    colors indicate a stronger relationship between the factors. The heatmap can help identify patterns that suggest
    a higher risk for developing diabetes, such as high glucose levels correlating strongly with high BMI and age.
  </p>
  <div>{{ graph_corr_diabetes | safe }}</div>

  <!-- Liver Insights -->
  <h2>Liver Insights</h2>

  <h3>Age Distribution (Liver)</h3>
  <p>This chart shows how liver health varies across different age groups. It helps us understand if certain liver
    conditions are more common in specific age ranges.
    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Liver diseases, such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis, become more common in
    older adults, particularly those over 50. However, the rise of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is
    noticeable among younger adults due to obesity and poor dietary habits.
  </p>
  <div>{{ graph_liver_age | safe }}</div>

  <h3>Total Bilirubin vs Alkaline Phosphatase</h3>
  <p>This graph shows the relationship between two liver enzymes: total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. These
    enzymes are important for liver function, and this chart helps us see if there's a connection between them.
    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Elevated bilirubin levels can indicate liver dysfunction or bile duct obstruction,
    while elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are often associated with liver damage or disease. A balance in these
    levels is crucial for healthy liver function.
  </p>
  <div>{{ graph_bilirubin_alp | safe }}</div>

  <h3>A/G Ratio Distribution (Liver)</h3>
  <p>This chart shows the distribution of the Albumin-to-Globulin (A/G) ratio in people with liver conditions. This
    ratio can help doctors assess liver health and function.
    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> A normal A/G ratio typically ranges between 1.1 and 2.5. A lower ratio (below 1.1)
    may indicate liver disease, malnutrition, or kidney conditions, while a higher ratio can be associated with
    certain types of infections or autoimmune disorders.
  </p>
  <div>{{ graph_ag_ratio | safe }}</div>

  <h3>Correlation Heatmap (Liver)</h3>
  <p>This heatmap shows the relationships between different liver-related factors. Just like the diabetes heatmap, it
    shows which factors are closely linked to each other in liver health. It is especially helpful in identifying
    patterns where liver health might be compromised by factors like obesity, diet, or pre-existing conditions.</p>
